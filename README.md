## ✨ About Me

I’m an aspiring **QA Engineer** with a non-traditional background that started in barbering and customer service and led me into software quality assurance. Precision, attention to detail, and understanding people were essential behind the barber’s chair—and they turn out to be just as powerful when testing software.

I’m passionate about building **smooth, reliable, user-friendly digital experiences**. I love breaking down requirements, exploring edge cases, and asking *“what happens if…?”* until the product feels solid from every angle. Whether I’m writing test cases, logging bugs, or automating flows, I bring curiosity, clarity, and care to every step.

I recently graduated from **TripleTen’s QA Engineering Bootcamp** and continue my education in **Software & AI Engineering**, with a long-term focus on **Computer Science (Business & AI pathway)**. I’m always learning, always improving, and genuinely excited about the future of quality engineering.

## 🧪 What I Bring to the Table

- Manual & automated testing with a **user-first mindset**
- Thoughtful test case design covering happy paths and edge cases
- Clear, actionable bug reports developers actually appreciate
- UI, API, and mobile application testing
- Automation using **Selenium (Python)** and **Playwright (JavaScript)**
- Strong collaboration, communication, and curiosity

## 🧠 QA Fun Fact

Years in customer-facing roles trained me to notice tiny inconsistencies before they became big problems. In QA, that means I test like a user, think like a teammate, and always ask one more question than expected.
