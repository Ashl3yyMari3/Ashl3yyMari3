# Hi there 👋

# 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Ashley Cichy — an aspiring QA Engineer with a unique journey from the world of barbering and customer service to software quality assurance. I’m passionate about ensuring seamless, user-friendly digital experiences through detailed testing, thoughtful design analysis, and automation.

💡 I recently graduated from TripleTen’s QA Engineering Bootcamp and am currently pursuing an AAS in Software & AI Engineering at Maestro College.

🧪 My toolkit includes Selenium, Playwright, Python, JavaScript, Postman, Jira, and Figma, with hands-on experience testing web, API, and mobile applications.

🚀 I’ve worked on projects like Urban Routes, Urban Grocers, Urban Scooters, and COLOrush, where I designed test cases, identified critical bugs, and implemented automation frameworks using Page Object Model principles.

💬 I love collaborating with developers, analyzing edge cases, and turning complex requirements into clear, testable outcomes.

Outside of tech, I bring creativity and empathy from my years behind the barber’s chair — qualities that help me see both the human and technical sides of quality assurance.

Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
