# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm Ashley Cichy â€” an aspiring QA Engineer with a unique journey from the world of barbering and customer service to software quality assurance. Iâ€™m passionate about ensuring seamless, user-friendly digital experiences through detailed testing, thoughtful design analysis, and automation.

ðŸ’¡ I recently graduated from TripleTenâ€™s QA Engineering Bootcamp and am currently pursuing an AAS in Software & AI Engineering at Maestro College.

ðŸ§ª My toolkit includes Selenium, Playwright, Python, JavaScript, Postman, Jira, and Figma, with hands-on experience testing web, API, and mobile applications.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™ve worked on projects like Urban Routes, Urban Grocers, Urban Scooters, and COLOrush, where I designed test cases, identified critical bugs, and implemented automation frameworks using Page Object Model principles.

ðŸ’¬ I love collaborating with developers, analyzing edge cases, and turning complex requirements into clear, testable outcomes.

Outside of tech, I bring creativity and empathy from my years behind the barberâ€™s chair â€” qualities that help me see both the human and technical sides of quality assurance.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Testing Tools: Selenium, Playwright, Postman, Jira, Chrome DevTools
Frameworks: Pytest, POM, CI/CD Basics
